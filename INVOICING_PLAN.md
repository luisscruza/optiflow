# Invoicing System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for adding an invoicing system to our Laravel workspace-based application. The system will include products, inventory management, stock movements between workspaces, quotations, and invoicing functionality.

## Database Schema Design
Based on the provided schema diagram, we need to implement the following entities:

### Core Entities
- **Products**: Product catalog with pricing and stock tracking
- **Taxes**: Tax rates and configurations
- **Document Subtypes**: Different types of documents (invoice, quotation, etc.)
- **Documents**: Main document entity for invoices and quotations
- **Document Items**: Line items within documents
- **Product Stocks**: Inventory levels per workspace
- **Stock Movements**: Tracking all inventory movements
- **Contacts**: Customers and suppliers (to be added)

## Technical Requirements

### Database Considerations
- All tables must include workspace_id for proper isolation
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexes for performance on frequently queried columns
- Soft deletes for important business data

### Security & Authorization
- Workspace-based access control
- Role-based permissions within workspaces
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Data validation and sanitization

### Performance Optimization
- Eager loading for related data
- Database query optimization
- Caching for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large datasets

### Code Quality
- Follow Laravel best practices
- Comprehensive documentation
- Type hints and return types
- PHPStan level 9 compliance

## Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create Core Migrations** - Start with the foundation database structure
2. **Build Models** - Implement Eloquent models with relationships
3. **Set Up Factories** - Create test data generators
4. **Write Basic Tests** - Ensure models work correctly

### Development Workflow
1. Create migration → Model → Factory → Tests → Controller → Frontend
2. Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
3. Run `vendor/bin/pint` after each change for code formatting
4. Use Pest for comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All core entities properly implemented
- [ ] Workspace isolation working correctly
- [ ] Stock tracking accurate and real-time
- [ ] Documents generate correctly with PDF output
- [ ] Inter-workspace transfers function properly
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] User-friendly interfaces for all features
- [ ] Performance optimized for production use

**Status**: Ready to begin implementation
**Next Action**: Create core database migrations starting with taxes and products
**Estimated Completion**: 14 weeks from start date
